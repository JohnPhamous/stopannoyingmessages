# Stop Annoying Messages (S.A.M.)

[Sam Don't-Spam](https://www.facebook.com/sam.dontspam.3) is a programatically controlled Facebook user who helps you reduce spam from overactive group messages.

## Usage

Sam is an ordinary Facebook user for you, so just go ahead and friend him! Once you add him to a group chat, go ahead and mute it indefinitely. Sam will keep an eye out for anyone mentioning your name, and send you a private message when they do. Sam can work with multiple groups for multiple users!

### Installing

Want your own Sam? First clone this repository and use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to import necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnPhamous/stopannoyingmessages.git
cd stopannoyingmessages
yarn install --ignore-engines
```

Now all you have to do is create a dummy Facebook account and provide the accounts username and password as environment variables when you run the server file. This can be done like so:

```bash
sam$ TODO
```
